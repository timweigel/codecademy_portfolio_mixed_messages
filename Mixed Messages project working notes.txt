Mixed Messages project working notes (separate from README)
A humorous (YMMV) database error message generator.
- Constructed to resemble syntax from sys.messsages (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-catalog-views/messages-for-errors-catalog-views-sys-messages?view=sql-server-ver15)
- Presentation along the lines of the SQL Server error log (timestamp, process ID, message)

The mealMaker project from the JavaScript Syntax II section is a good model for this.

SELECT
    message_id
    , severity
    , is_event_logged
    , text
FROM sys.messages
WHERE language_id = 1033
	AND text LIKE '%!%%' ESCAPE '!';
GO

to get sysmessages contents for US English that contain % characters.

Message examples from sys.messages:

Cannot convert data type %ls to %ls.
The collation '%.*ls' of receiving variable is not equal to the collation '%.*ls' of column '%.*ls'.
Cannot find %S_MSG ID %d in database ID %d.
The index "%.*ls" for table "%.*ls" (RowsetId %I64d) resides on a read-only filegroup ("%.*ls"), which cannot be modified.
Could not disable support for %ls in database '%.*ls' because %S_MSG.
Could not enable support for %ls in database '%.*ls' because %S_MSG.

and so on.

To keep this project simple, I will include 3 classes of message, each with 3 segments, each containing a variable. I'll have 3 possible things that can go in each variable. This will allow for a reasonable number of possible outcomes with enough complexity to make me stretch, but not so much that I can't complete the project within my set timeline.

Message classes:
- Security
	- Login failures, stuff like that.
- File
	- Files are full, disks are full, files are missing, what have you
- Data
	- Along the lines of data type errors, truncation messages, stuff like that

Data structure (I do databases for a living, can you tell?)	
messageTypes:
- Array with 2 values:
	- type number
		1, 2, 3
	- type description
		security, file, data respectively

messageSegments:
- Array with n values:
	- type number
		- 1, 2, or 3; this would be a foreign key reference in a database
	- segment position
		- begin
			- 1
		- mid
			- 2
		- end
			- 3
	- segment text

messageVariables:
- Array with n values
	- type number
		- 1, 2, or 3
	- segment number
		- 1, 2, or 3
	- content
		- Single word or short phrase appropriate to the type and segment
