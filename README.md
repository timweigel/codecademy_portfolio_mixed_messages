# codecademy_portfolio_mixed_messages
## A repository for my Mixed Messages portfolio project, from Codecademy's Back-End Engineer path

This readme file will be updated as the project progressses.

The objective is to develop a message generator that composes random messages from at least 3 random pieces of data. I will be developing a message generator that produces humorous (results may vary) database error messages in the style of SQL Server error messages, presented in the error log format.

This project is developed in JavaScript, tested on node.js version 15.6.0.

Project start date is Wednesday, 17 Feb 2021. Target completion date is Wednesday, 24 Feb 2021. I plan to work on this at least one hour each day until completed.
