# codecademy_portfolio_mixed_messages
## A repository for my Mixed Messages portfolio project, from Codecademy's Back-End Engineer path

This readme file will be updated as the project progressses.

The objective is to develop a message generator that composes random messages from at least 3 random pieces of data.

This project is developed in JavaScript, tested on node.js version 15.6.0.

Target completion date is Wednesday, 24 Feb 2021. I plan to work on this at least one hour each day until completed.

Gracious thanks to Sonic Youth for supplying the soundtrack for my development efforts.
